Please follow the instructions below to compile the program scene-start:

1. Open a terminal window and change directory (using the 'cd' command)
   to where scene-start.cpp is.

2. Type: ./setup-once
   Note: You only need to do this once.

3. Type: ls -l
   You should see two small symbolic link files (created by Step 2
   above) pointing to the actual dynamic library file.

4. Type: make
   This should compile scene-start.cpp and create the executable program
   scene-start.

5. Type: source ./setup
   You need to do this command every time you open a new terminal window.

6. Type: ./scene-start
   to run the skeleton program scene-start generated from the compilation
   (step 4 above).
   Note: you need to make sure the models-textures directory is in the
   same directory as scene-start.cpp
